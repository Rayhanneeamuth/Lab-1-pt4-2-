I think the picture class draws the picture by setting the outline of the picture by the calling method named "SetBalckAndWhite" and with the calling method "setColor" it sets the colors where needed to create the image.
I completed challenge 18
I completed challenge 19
I completed challenge 20
By doing the calling method the "GetName" it gives the information about the student(#22)
#24 indentifies how many students are in the class.
